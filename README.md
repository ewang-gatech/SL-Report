# SL-Report
This repository holds the code necessary to run the machine learning experiments described in the SL Report.

# Required libraries
Install the libararies listed in requirements.txt


# Reproduction
First run the Preprocess_Analysis ipynbs to first generate the analysis and prequisite files. For the individual machine learning experiments, each experiment set is labeled by their dataset and algorithim, for example Cancer_NN.ipynb. Run the relevant ipynb from start to finish to see the results.
